                <h2>My Cloud Engineering Journey at Alt School</h2>

                <p>I am currently studying Cloud Engineering at Alt School Africa.</p>

                <p>
                    I enrolled into Alt School Africa to study cloud engineering. below are the several compelling
                    reasons why I became interested in studying cloud engineering:
                    <br><br>
                    High Demand for Cloud Professionals: Cloud computing is a rapidly growing field, and there is a high
                    demand for skilled cloud engineers. Many organizations are migrating to the cloud, which has created
                    a substantial job market for cloud professionals.

                    <br><br>
                    Cost-Effective Learning: Many cloud service providers offer free tiers or low-cost options for
                    experimentation and learning. This makes it relatively affordable to gain practical experience in
                    cloud engineering.
                    <br><br>
                    Security and Compliance: Understanding cloud security is critical, and cloud engineers often play a
                    significant role in ensuring data security and compliance with regulations. This knowledge is
                    increasingly valuable.
                    <br><br>
                    Continuous Learning: Cloud technologies are constantly evolving. Cloud engineers must stay up to
                    date with the latest trends and best practices, making it an intellectually stimulating field.
                    <br><br>
